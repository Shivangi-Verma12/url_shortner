ðŸ§  What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in EJS?
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in EJS (Embedded JavaScript) means:

Your HTML pages are generated on the server, using dynamic data, before being sent to the user's browser.

ðŸ§± In Practice (How EJS Works with SSR):
You write an .ejs file (like a template).

Your server (Node.js + Express) uses that file to render a complete HTML page with real data filled in.

The user receives a ready-to-display HTML â€” no JavaScript is needed on the client to assemble it.
